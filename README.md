paleofetch
==========

Like neofetch, but incomplete, written in ~200 lines of C instead of 10,000 lines of bash,
and runs in like 0.005 seconds.

This is a WIP, and definitely not a minimum viable product.

If anyone has input for the features I have yet to implement, I would love to hear them.

Example output:
